# History and Legitimacy

## History

This proposal is based on work done in the French GenAI "DO TANK" during 2024 and 2025.

- In December 2024, the AMADEUS GenAI for Engineering Experience team began creating so-called OLAF (Open Lightweight Assistant Framework). This framework aimed to assist internal users to better perform their tasks with AI agents. It provided a set of skills, competencies, and collections, but also a structure to ease the delivery of those artifacts, conventions, and practices.
- In March 2025, the framework was presented to the AMADEUS engineering community, and the set of skills and their format were improved, as was the delivery from multiple registries.
- In June 2025, the OLAF skills were presented to external enterprises and shared through AMADEUS's Public Open Source contribution. This was not advertised outside this closed community.
- In October 2025, OLAF was widely presented and proposed to members of the French GenAI "DO TANK."
- In December 2025, Anthropic proposed SKILLS as a standard. While not exactly the same as OLAF Skills in naming convention, they served the same needs and were based on the same principles.
- Based on this record, it was decided to reframe OLAF as a seminal work to propose a standard.

## Legitimacy

While OLAF was heavily based on skills, competencies, and collections, it allowed us to experiment and establish structures, practices, conventions, and artifacts that we believe will directly and strongly benefit all users when implemented in all solutions.

While OLAF was not aimed at being a standard, it is a solid foundation for a standard. It will benefit from the experience of all who have implemented similar solutions. 

In that regard, we welcome contributions from experienced users and implementers of similar solutions.

**We strongly believe that the sooner a standard on this topic emerges, the better it will be for all users, enterprises, and vendors.**
